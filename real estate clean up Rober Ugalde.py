Observations and Analysis:
Price Distribution:

The histogram will show the spread of property prices 
in "Arroyomolinos (Madrid)." For example:
If the bars are concentrated around a specific range,
 it suggests most properties are priced similarly.
A wider spread indicates diverse pricing.
Peaks:

Peaks (tall bars) in the histogram represent price ranges 
with a high number of properties.
A peak at a lower price range might suggest affordability in that area.

Outliers:

If there are bars far away from the rest of the distribution,
 it may indicate outliers, such as luxury home

Leganés and Alcorcón exhibit more consistent pricing patterns.
Fuenlabrada and Getafe show greater variability, likely reflecting a mix of affordable and higher-priced houses.
Spread:

Some populations (e.g., Getafe) have a wider spread, indicating more variability in housing prices.
Other populations (e.g., Alcorcón) appear more compact, suggesting a more uniform pricing structure.

Outliers:

The presence of bars extending far to the right (e.g., near 4 or 5) may indicate extremely expensive houses relative to the population average.
